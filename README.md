# Reinforcement learning optimization for radiotherapy treatments
Reinforcement Learning Open-Source Project for Radiotherapy Treatments. 



## Key points



## Description

We used a cellular model that results from the combination of a cellular model developed by [A. Jalalimanesh](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378475416300878) and another one developed by [O'Neil](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/2831/). Reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, Sarsa and Expected Sarsa) are used to provide optimizations on radiotherapy treatments. The goal of this work is to generate superior radiotherapy treatment plans concerning Tumor Control Probability (TCP), number of radiation fractions, total radiation dose, treatment duration, and healthy cell survival rate.
