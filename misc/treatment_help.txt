During the simulation, you have the option to choose the radiotherapy treatment you wish to apply. You can select from the baseline treatment or several different reinforcement learning agents that have been trained beforehand. To help you make an informed decision, the performance of each agent is compared to the baseline treatment using a summary table, which displays the mean and standard deviation of multiple indicators of performance.

In addition to the summary table, a boxplot is available to visually highlight the distribution of the performances of the selected agent. The performance indicators include the number of fractions used by the agent for different simulations, the duration of the treatment for different simulations, and the survival percentage of healthy cells expressed on a scale of 1.

If you wish to add more agents to the simulation, you can train them yourself and add them to the TabularAgentResults folder using the same bill of materials as the ones used previously (i.e. Agent_name and Number). This provides you with the opportunity to expand the range of options available to you for selecting the most appropriate radiotherapy treatment.
