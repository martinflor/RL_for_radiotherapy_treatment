A Linear Quadratic function is used to model the response of cancer cells to radiotherapy. The stage duration plays a significant role in determining the likelihood that a radiation dose will be administered at a specific stage. 

For example, the Mitosis phase is consistently the shortest phase, lasting approximately an hour. 

Consequently, it is less probable that the majority of cells will be in this stage when the radiation dose is administered. 

To account for this, a weighted average is calculated to represent the radiosensitivity across the entire cell cycle (excluding the quiescence state).
