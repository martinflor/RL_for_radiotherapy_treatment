The Cell Cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication. It is composed of four distinct phases: Gap 1, Synthesis, Gap 2, and Mitosis. In animal cells, this cycle typically lasts for an average of 24 hours.

The duration of each phase can be adjusted by the user, but only integer values are accepted. The initial cell cycle has a baseline duration of 24 hours, and healthy cells maintain this cycle length. On the other hand, cancer cells have a modified cycle length as determined by the user.

For animal cells, the duration of Gap 1 can vary between 5 to 12 hours, while Synthesis typically lasts for 8 to 10 hours. Gap 2 usually takes 2 to 4 hours, and the Mitosis phase is typically the shortest, lasting only 1 hour.

The phase of the cell cycle that can vary the most in duration is the Gap 1 phase, while the Mitotic phase is always relatively short.

To illustrate the proportions and duration of each phase, a plot with two sub-pie charts can be used. The first sub-pie chart represents the baseline cycle with a duration of 24 hours, while the second sub-pie chart shows the modified cycle with the adjusted phase durations.
